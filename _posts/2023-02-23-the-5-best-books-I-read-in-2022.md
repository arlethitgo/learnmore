description: My highly recommended books in 2022
read-time: 2 min

I set my reading goal for 2022 with 24 books, approximately 2 books a month. I came up a book short at 23 books. That was 6,872 pages read (299 pages per book on average). The shortest book I read was Pablo Neruda's Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair and my longest book was Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. I had an equal taste for fiction (12 books) and non-fiction (11 books). My top 3 genres were self-help, classics and fantasy.

There were 5 books that made it to my highly-recommended list. They really stood out for me and I will always think fondly of when I read these books.

1) The Good Women of China: Hidden Voices by Xinran

        My heart broke 10 times as I read this book. I definitely cried. The world is a cruel place. As much as I recommend this, I do advise people to be in the right headspace and mindset when they read this.
    
2) The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid

        Highly recommended! Such a page-turner, I simply can't put it down. I was reading this in bed and I couldn't sleep without finishing the story. Evelyn is such an interesting character that I am so enamored to know everything about her.
        P.S. This book reminded that I'm not straight HAHA. 
    
3) Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair by Pablo Neruda

        Wow! This is definitely a must read! So much feelings were happening while I was reading this. The imagery and words were very vivid. Now, I want to learn Spanish to understand it in the native language it was written in.
        "How terrible and brief was my desire of you!
            How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid."

4) Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind

<div> <img src=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1595674533i/23692271.jpg alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/></div>         
        
        I highly recommend reading this book. It takes you to an epic journey of Sapiens throughout histyroy. The storytelling is superb and easy to digest. It is thought-provoking and very interesting. 

5) Sky Burial: An Epic Love Story of Tibet by Xinran

![skyburial][5]

        I read this book in a single afternoon. This was simply another amazing storytelling from Xinran. This is an eye-opening tale about the unique culture of Tibet. It's a extraordinary story of a really long love and dedication.

This 2023, I set my reading goal to 26 books (a book every 2 weeks). I think reading is a very nice hobby. I truly enjoy doing it. Check out what I'm currently reading at [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/142204442-jane-arleth).
