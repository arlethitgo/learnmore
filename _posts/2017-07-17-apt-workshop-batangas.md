The [Ateneo Innovation Center (AIC)](https://www.ateneoinnovation.org/) has been part of numerous research collaborations with both local and international industries. One recent collaboration that I have been a part of is a collaborative research towards creating standard specifications of information and communications systems using vehicles during disasters.  This effort is culminating with the convergence of Industry, Government and Academe contributors in the Philippines to complete the V-Hub standards specification this year.

Over the last five years researchers from throughout ASEAN and Japan have developed vehicle communications and information systems for disaster risk reduction and management. All these researchers have experienced how society is vulnerable by natural disaster. They submitted use cases for the V-Hub technology platform. The [Asia-Pacific Telecommunity (APT)](https://www.apt.int/) sponsored a workshop in the Philippines to develop the  V-Hub Standard for disasters as a powerful new platform for vehicular communications and information systems.

The Ateneo Innovation Center served as the organizing body of the workshop. I became one of the organizers and participants of the workshop.
