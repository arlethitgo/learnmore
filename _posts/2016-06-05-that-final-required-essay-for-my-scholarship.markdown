description: My Ateneo Education’s Take on Service and Leadership

I am now approaching my last year as an undergraduate here in the Ateneo. As I look back, I see how much I’ve grown; from the very young and naive girl who started out with no previously known friends in Ateneo at all to an independent lady who has come to find a second family in the comfort of my friends. Four years in this institution changed my life. My Ateneo education taught me core values on leadership and service that I believe made me a better version of myself. One more year and I get to make a decision with where I would direct my life to be.

For my senior year, I took overload semesters. I failed a subject during my junior year so I had to retake it first semester of my senior year. In addition, I was in a basic English class during my freshman year so I had to take a supposed sophomore summer course during the second semester. Senior year was quite difficult for me so I decided to forego joining the table tennis varsity team for another UAAP tournament stint. I continue to train to continue to reinforce my skills but decided not to be team captain because I wasn’t competing in the most significant tournament, the UAAP. I decided to set my priorities toward my academics with a very loaded semester. I joined my home organization Ateneo Electronics and Computer Engineering Society (AECES), Ateneo Comelec and the Rizal Library Ambassadors. As much as I wanted to step up and lead in a project or two, I failed to do so because I was just too busy. Still, I did some volunteering in projects and joining the core team, hence had some service experiences. On the contrary, I had a quite limited experience in leadership. For my senior year, it is through the classroom that I learned quite a lot about service and leadership. My philosophy and theology classes have equipped me with valuable lessons in life. The values of *cura personalis* and *magis* have encouraged me not to be a person who is self-centered but rather to be a person-for-others. Ateneo’s holistic formation has molded me to make use of all my learning not just those from my academics but also from other extra-curricular activities as well. Ateneo showed me how much I truly love learning.

Summing all my experiences this senior year, I have decided to go to graduate school and pursue a master’s degree in either electronics engineering or information technology after graduation. First, I would apply for academic scholarships for graduate school. If I would be unsuccessful, I would apply for an athletic scholarship. I still have two remaining years to play in the UAAP tournament, if given the opportunity that would be two years of athletic scholarship.
