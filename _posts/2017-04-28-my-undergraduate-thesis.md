description: Design and Development of Decision Support System Using Near Cloud for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction
---

In my research entitled, Design and Development of Decision Support System Using Near Cloud for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction, I  used “near clouds” (mobile cloud) to gather and distribute intelligent information before, during, and after disasters. These nodes are cached in with key information and data needed for disasters i.e. maps, message reports, and images. The nodes serve as the  command and control in early warning and disaster  management systems. The main accomplishments for my research include the following:

1.  Design of a post-disaster information system
2.  Develop use cases for field-deployable kiosks and command and control for post-disaster environments
3.  Develop a near-cloud based multi-interfaced enabling platform for future use cases. Please see attached files for more information.

> Abstract—In disaster scenarios, the lack of wireless internet or weak cellular network signal poses a very real threat to crucial information gathering and sharing. Using Near Cloud to store, load and upload information, this project has designed and developed decision support nodes that is able to gather and distribute intelligent information before, during, and after disasters. These nodes are cached in with key information and data needed for disasters i.e. maps, message reports, and images. The nodes serve as the command and control in early warning and disaster management systems. Key capabilities featured in for the decision support node include: broadcast mode that is broadcasting message via RF, mapping and visualization, data mining, near cloud, and the medical decision support system.  A decision support node architecture is then  developed and proposed as the main command and control as mobile kiosks. This mobile kiosk architecture is developed with a number of nodes each of which are connected to perform and handle one application in a grid pattern.

You can find my IEEE-format paper [here][2]. This project is part of the bigger research project with the Ateneo Innovation Center that produced a paper entitled, ['Demonstrations of post-disaster resilient communications and decision-support platform with UAVs, ground teams and vehicles using delay-tolerant information networks on sub-GHz frequencies'][3].
