 Previously, I was a Data Scientist in the Philippines' oldest conglomerate, 
[Ayala Corporation](https://ayala.com/) , where I applied analytics methods, data science and machine learning best practice
to solve complex business problems and to help in data-driven corporate decision-making. I have had
valuable data science and software engineering work experience from [SAS Institute](https://www.sas.com/nl_nl/home.html), the leader in analytics and
from my international internship experiences at [CERN](https://home.cern/) in Switzerland, [Weathernews Inc.](https://global.weathernews.com/) and
